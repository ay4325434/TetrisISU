 --- TETRIS ISU ---

Instructions:
Pieces, consisting of four blocks, will drop down into a board.
You can speed it up by holding the down key or pressing space.

When a row is completely filled with blocks, the row will be cleared and the blocks
above will be shifted down according to the number of rows cleared. If you clear multiple
rows at once, you will receive a higher score. Combos (clearing lines on consecutive turns)
will also provide a score bonus.

When your pieces reach the top, the game will end of a block interferes with the next
piece's starting position (top middle of the board).

The more lines you clear, the faster the pieces will drop!

The hold slot is a place where you can temporarily store a piece for better use. If a piece is already
in the hold slot, the piece in the hold slot and your current block will be switched. The hold function
can only be used once per piece. It resets once your current piece is dropped on the board.

The next five pieces will be shown to you in queue. They are determined randomly after the starting bag.

A back-to-back chain is obtained by clearing lines using spins or quads. It breaks when lines are cleared
without those methods. A back-to-back chain also increases your score.

Keybinds:
Left arrow - Move piece left
Right arrow - Move piece right
Up arrow/X - Rotate piece clockwise
Down arrow: Move piece down (soft drop)
Space: Hard drop (instantly drops piece to the bottom or on another piece)
Shift: Hold
Z: Rotate counterclockwise
A: Rotate 180 degrees
P: Pause
Esc: Return to main menu if paused

Tips and tricks:
- Clean stacking: Try to make your stack flat. It opens up more potential to clear lines.
- Spins: Rotating a piece into a stuck position results in a Spin, which provides score bonuses.
- Build a B2B chain: To get a higher score, build up a B2B chain by performing quads, spins, or All
  Clears per consecutive line clear. Whenever you clear lines using this technique, your line clear
  bonus is multiplied by your current B2B chain if greater than 1. If your B2B chain is greater than
  4, breaking it allows for a surge bonus, equal to 100 * current level * B2B chain before breaking.
- Playing quickly and efficiently: This essentially allows you to play infinitely because there is
  a maximum gravity limit. There is no way to skip any levels.

Bugs:
- The I-piece doesn't rely on the SRS rotation systems. Wall kicks may be bugged for those pieces.
- Bouncing: If you press any key, there is a small chance that it registers two presses. This can usually
  be fixed by pressing the key a little harder.
- The player level currently caps at 26 due to line clearing logic.
- Back button may not register your clicks sometimes.

Implemented features:
- SRS rotation system with wall kicks
- Music selection
- Changing background music as player level increases
